General Requirements:
---------------------
from the general notes:

We will be presenting projects on Friday. Your project must have:

- validations
- tests
- at least two models
- user stories
- ERDs
- a seeds file
- documentation
  - set up instructions
  - good commit messages

from the flash card notes:

    ## Gameplay

    - When starting the application, prompt the user to:
      - Create a new flashcard
      - View all flashcards
      atom- Edit a flashcard
      - Delete a flashcard
      - View score / recent answers

    ## Requirements

    - The player should be able to quit the command line and resume their game later.
    - The player should be able to see their score and how many cards/questions they got right.
    - Allow users to create lists or categories of flashcards.
    - Allow users to view only the flashcards in one particular category or another.



    ## Bonus

    - If the user does not get a question right, add that card back in to the mix and keep asking until they get it right.
    - Record the number of attempts a user makes to answer a question.


Keith's thoughts:
  1. Create a main menu the for the control  --done
  2. Actual actions can be carried out by separate models.
  3. need to store data to a database
      ---databases should have categories (for game categories)
      ---will need to map out columns
      ---store results of correct answer as true/false values in a result column
      ---when creating flash cards compare one column vs another.  if it is correct, the value will be true, if it is wron it will be false.
