Setup
-----

I  had some real isssues trying to get my tables to sync up, so there was no real time to
set up a seed file.

I apologize, but in order to start, please create a database titled "flashcards_db" in psql
before running the program.  When the program starts, please enter "CreateFlashcards.new" to load the program.

Once in the program, the prompts are self-explanatory.

User stories
------------
I set up most of my user stories on my trello board, but here are what I had listed:

  1. Current
    --"As a user, when I select "Create Flashcard"  then I should see a prompt asking for subject, question and answer."
    --"As a user, when I select "View Flashcard", i should see a prompt asking for what subject and then I will be shown the list of cards in that subject."
    --"As a user, when I select "Edit Flashcard" I should see a prompt asking to edit which field that I would like to edit."
    --"As a user, when I select "Edit Flashcard" I should see a prompt asking to edit which field that I would like to edit."
    --"As a user, when I select "Delete Flashcard" I should see a prompt asking for what subject and a list of available cards for that deck."
    --"As a user,, when I select "View Scores/Recent Answers" will show the percentage of correct/incorrect as well as any unanswered flashcards in that deck."

  2. Backlog
    --"As a user when I select "Edit Flashcard" I should see an option to resort the deck."
    --"As a user when I select "View Flashcard" it may trigger the game."

  3. Icebox
    --"As a user, I shouldn't be allowed to edit answers.  I should create an admin page."
